# Nightlight

This is a test application built in CodeIgniter 3.x. as I attempt to learn the framework in preparation for working with legacy projects. It uses some third party libraries to enable Twig and authorisation support.

It's a conversion of a vanilla PHP application I built about five years ago, and so continues to use its Bootstrap 3 + jQuery styling, because rebuilding the interface is, for the time being, not essential to my learning.
